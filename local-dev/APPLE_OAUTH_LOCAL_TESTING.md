# Apple OAuth Local Testing Setup

## Problem
Apple Sign-In doesn't accept `localhost` as a redirect URI, so we need an HTTPS tunnel to test locally.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: ngrok (Recommended for Quick Setup)

#### Setup
1. Install ngrok:
   ```bash
   brew install ngrok
   # or download from https://ngrok.com/download
   ```

2. Sign up for free account at https://ngrok.com (optional but recommended)

3. Authenticate (if signed up):
   ```bash
   ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

4. Start tunnel to local app:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 58000
   ```

5. Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`)

#### Important Notes
- **Free tier**: Domain changes each time you restart ngrok
- **Solution**: Get the domain and register it on Apple Developer Console
- If domain changes, just register the new one on Apple Developer Console

#### ngrok Static Domain (Paid Option)
If you need a persistent domain:
- Upgrade to ngrok paid plan ($8/month)
- Configure a static domain in ngrok dashboard
- Use: `ngrok http 58000 --domain=your-static-domain.ngrok-free.app`

### Option 2: Cloudflare Tunnel (Free, Persistent Domain)

**Note**: Requires a domain you own and have added to Cloudflare.

#### Setup
1. Install cloudflared:
   ```bash
   brew install cloudflared
   # or download from https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/
   ```

2. Login to Cloudflare:
   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel login
   ```

3. Create a named tunnel:
   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel create caramel-local-dev
   ```

4. Create config file `~/.cloudflared/config.yml`:
   ```yaml
   tunnel: caramel-local-dev
   credentials-file: /Users/kd/.cloudflared/[TUNNEL-UUID].json
   
   ingress:
     - hostname: caramel-local.yourdomain.com
       service: http://localhost:58000
     - service: http_status:404
   ```

5. Route the subdomain (in Cloudflare dashboard or via CLI):
   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel route dns caramel-local-dev caramel-local.yourdomain.com
   ```

6. Run the tunnel:
   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel run caramel-local-dev
   ```

#### Result
- Persistent HTTPS URL: `https://caramel-local.yourdomain.com`
- Free and stable - perfect for ongoing development

## Apple Developer Console Configuration

Once you have your HTTPS domain, share it with your team lead. They need to add **both** redirect URIs:

1. **Better-auth callback** (for web app):
   ```
   https://[your-domain]/api/auth/callback/apple
   ```

2. **Extension intermediate redirect** (for extension OAuth):
   ```
   https://[your-domain]/api/extension/oauth/redirect
   ```

For example:
- ngrok: 
  - `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/api/auth/callback/apple`
  - `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/api/extension/oauth/redirect`
- Cloudflare: 
  - `https://caramel-local.yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/apple`
  - `https://caramel-local.yourdomain.com/api/extension/oauth/redirect`

**Note**: The extension uses `form_post` response mode (required by Apple when requesting email scope), so the intermediate redirect endpoint handles the POST from Apple and forwards the code to the extension.

## Recommended Approach

**For quick testing**: Use ngrok free tier
- Fastest setup
- Register domain on Apple Developer Console when it changes
- No domain ownership required

**For ongoing development**: Use Cloudflare Tunnel
- Persistent domain (no changes)
- Free
- Requires domain ownership

---

## Environment Variables

Your local app should use the tunnel URL. Update `.env.ports`:

```bash
# For ngrok/Cloudflare tunnel
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://your-tunnel-domain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-tunnel-domain.com
```

Or set them temporarily when running:
```bash
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://abc123.ngrok-free.app NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://abc123.ngrok-free.app pnpm dev
```
