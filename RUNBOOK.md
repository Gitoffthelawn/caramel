# Caramel — Operations Runbook

Start here at 3am. This is the repo-provided starting point that didn't
exist before F-011 (audit 2026-07-10, `empirical-3am.md` AM-1/AM-9 in the
maintainers' internal audit archive):
where things run, where to look, how to check health, how to roll back, and
the failure signatures worth recognizing on sight.

This file lives at the repo root (not `docs/`) so a cold on-call finds it
with `ls` or a repo search without knowing the doc structure first.

## Where to look

- **Dokploy** (deploy dashboard, logs, container status, rollback): the
  team's Dokploy instance is `https://devino.basa-ulmer.ts.net/`.
  TODO(human): confirm this is the instance hosting caramel-app, and record
  the exact project/application name within it (this repo has zero tracked
  Dokploy config — `git grep -i dokploy` across the whole tree turns up one
  code comment and nothing else, so the app/project name cannot be derived
  from source).
- **Sentry**: `https://sentry.devino.ca`, org `devino`, project `caramel`.
  Errors from caught route failures (`handleRouteError`, F-002) are tagged
  `route`/`method`/`requestId`; uncaught render errors reach it via
  `error.tsx`/`global-error.tsx` (F-011) and `instrumentation.ts`'s
  `onRequestError`. TODO(human): confirm/record the alert routing (which
  Sentry alert rule pages who, and where — Slack/email/PagerDuty).
- **GitHub Actions**: `.github/workflows/checks-app.yml` (lint / prettier /
  typecheck / knip / unit / oxlint / schema-drift / integration / e2e),
  `checks-extension.yml` (lint / prettier / unit / size-limit),
  `release-extension.yml` (packages the extension on merge to `main`).
- **Uptime monitor**: `src/app/api/health/db/route.ts`'s comments reference
  an external Uptime-Kuma monitor polling this route. TODO(human): record
  its dashboard URL and which monitor entry it is — not present in this
  repo.

## Health checks

`GET /api/health/db` — probes the two data dependencies of this app
(auth_db via Prisma `SELECT 1`, and the app-owned coupon catalog's
non-emptiness + freshness via `prisma.coupon.aggregate` — F-001).
Requires `Authorization: Bearer $UPKUMA_HEALTH_SECRET`; no header (or a
wrong one) is a fail-closed `401` with zero DB calls made.

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $UPKUMA_HEALTH_SECRET" \
  https://grabcaramel.com/api/health/db
```

Response shape:

```json
{
  "status": "ok" | "error",
  "checks": {
    "auth_db": { "status": "ok" | "error", "service": "auth_db", "latencyMs": 5, "details"?: "..." },
    "catalog": { "status": "ok" | "error", "service": "catalog", "latencyMs": 8, "details": { "count": 1234, "freshestUpdatedAt": "2026-07-14T…", "ageMinutes": 12, "stale": false } }
  }
}
```

The `catalog` check is `ok` iff the aggregate query succeeds AND the catalog is
NON-EMPTY (`count > 0`); its `details` is the structured freshness object above
(or the raw error string on an unexpected throw). `stale` (newest row older than
48h) is observability only — it NEVER flips the check to error.

HTTP status: `200` iff **both** checks are `"ok"`; `503` if **either** is
down; `401` unauthenticated. The monitor's contract (HTTP status code +
top-level `status`) is preserved across the F-001 body-shape change, so an
existing external monitor configured against the old single-DB shape still
alarms correctly.

**If the `catalog` check reports down:** it went `error` because the catalog is
EMPTY (`count === 0`) or the query threw (DB/table unreachable) — NOT for
staleness (a stale-but-non-empty catalog stays `ok`, surfacing `stale: true`).
An empty catalog usually means migrations/seed never ran, or (in prod) the
supplier feed hasn't populated it: confirm `prisma migrate deploy` ran, and that
the pipeline is pushing to `POST /api/ingest/catalog` or the `bridge:sync` job is
running (see "Coupons ingest & bridge sync" below and docs/INGEST.md).

**If auth_db reports down:** login/signup/session-dependent routes are
broken. Check Dokploy's Postgres container/managed DB status first.

## Deploys & rollback

Deploys run through Dokploy. TODO(human): record the exact deploy trigger
(push to `main`? manual redeploy button?) and the precise rollback
procedure (Dokploy has a rollback-to-previous-deployment action in its UI —
confirm the button location for this specific application) — this repo
carries a DB-migration step (`prisma migrate deploy`, see
`package.json`'s `db:migrate:deploy`) but **no app-deploy workflow, and no
rollback automation or documentation existed anywhere in the tracked files
before this doc** (confirmed: `git grep -i dokploy` across the repo,
excluding `audit/`, returns a single code comment).

Until the TODO above is filled in, the safe manual sequence is:

1. Confirm the outage via `/api/health/db` and Sentry.
2. Open the Dokploy dashboard, find the caramel-app application, and use
   its deployment history to redeploy the last known-good build.
3. Re-run the [post-deploy smoke check](#post-deploy-smoke-check) against
   the rolled-back deployment before declaring it resolved.
4. If the regression was a DB migration, `prisma migrate deploy` is
   forward-only — a bad migration needs a new forward migration or a
   manual DB fix, not a Prisma-level rollback.

### Branch protection (handoff, not yet applied)

Repo settings are not something an agent mutates. The exact commands,
carried from F-009's plan and the audit PR body, for a human to run once
this audit branch merges to real `main`/`dev`:

```bash
gh api -X PUT repos/DevinoSolutions/caramel/branches/<branch>/protection --input protection.json
```

where `protection.json` is:

```json
{
    "required_status_checks": {
        "strict": true,
        "contexts": [
            "lint",
            "prettier",
            "typecheck",
            "knip",
            "oxlint",
            "Schema Drift",
            "checks",
            "E2E & Visual Regression (PR)"
        ]
    },
    "enforce_admins": true,
    "required_pull_request_reviews": { "required_approving_review_count": 1 },
    "restrictions": null
}
```

Run for each of `main` and `dev`. Verify current state first with
`gh api repos/DevinoSolutions/caramel/branches/main/protection` (as of the
audit, this returned `404 Branch not protected`).

## Known failure modes

- **Catalog schema drift.** `src/lib/couponsDb.ts`'s zod boundary throws
  loudly (`coupons-db schema drift [<query>]: ...`) the instant a read call
  site's expected columns/types don't match what the app catalog returns,
  instead of silently serving malformed/zeroed data. These throws reach
  Sentry via `handleRouteError` (API routes) or `onRequestError`/`error.tsx`
  (the SSR store page). The proactive half is now the **integration suite**
  (`pnpm --filter caramel-app test:integration` — `coupons-read.itest.ts`,
  `coupons-write.itest.ts`, `ingest-catalog.itest.ts`, `bridge-sync.itest.ts`)
  running the real queries against a live app Postgres in CI; it REPLACED the
  deleted structural drift gate (`check:coupons-schema` / `EXPECTED_COLUMNS` /
  `couponsQueryProbes`, removed in W4).
- **Ingest push refused (tombstone gate).** `POST /api/ingest/catalog` returns
  `409 {error, gate}` (and the `bridge:sync` job logs `REFUSED` + exits
  non-zero, writing NOTHING) when a single push would expire/tombstone >20% of
  the currently-visible catalog. This is the wholesale-wipe guard, not a bug: a
  broken producer cannot nuke the catalog with one bad push. A human confirms
  the mass-expiry is legitimate, then re-runs with `force` (see "Coupons ingest
  & bridge sync" below). Any OTHER error out of `applyCatalogRows` (bad data
  mid-batch, DB loss) rolls the whole transaction back and reaches Sentry via
  `handleRouteError` — never a partial write.
- **Catalog empty / unreachable.** `/api/health/db`'s `catalog` check goes
  `"error"` when the catalog is EMPTY (`count === 0`) or the aggregate query
  throws (DB/table unreachable), returning `503`. NOT for staleness — a
  stale-but-non-empty catalog stays `ok` with `stale: true`. An empty catalog in
  prod means the pipeline/bridge has not populated it; locally it means `prisma
migrate deploy` (which also seeds) has not run.
- **Caught route errors used to vanish.** Before F-002, every
  `catch (error) { ... return 500 }` site swallowed the error — only
  truly uncaught errors reached Sentry. `handleRouteError`
  (`src/lib/api/handleRouteError.ts`) closes that gap: every caught route
  error now reports to Sentry (tagged `route`/`method`/`requestId`) and
  returns a distinguishable `{error}` body + `x-request-id` response
  header. If you're grepping logs for a specific failed request, match on
  that header's value against the Sentry `requestId` tag.
- **Uncaught render errors used to show Next's generic error page.**
  F-011 adds `apps/caramel-app/src/app/error.tsx` (route-segment boundary,
  renders inside the root layout, reports to Sentry) and `global-error.tsx`
  (last-resort — fires only when the ROOT layout itself throws; replaces
  the entire document, so it's deliberately dependency-free: no Providers,
  no data fetching, inline styles only). Both report via
  `Sentry.captureException` in a `useEffect`.
- **`COUPONS_ADMIN_SECRET` unset or wrong.** Gates both `POST
/api/coupons/expire` and the rate-limit trust exemption
  (`isTrustedServer` in `src/lib/rateLimit.ts`). Unset → fail-closed (every
  caller treated as untrusted/unauthorized, never fail-open). **This
  secret must be set in Dokploy for caramel-app's production/staging
  environment** — it replaces the old `EXTENSION_API_KEY`, which is
  retired (F-003) and no longer shipped to or accepted from the extension.
- **`UPKUMA_HEALTH_SECRET` unset.** `/api/health/db` fail-closes to `401`
  even with a bearer header sent — this is intentional (see
  `tests/unit/health-db.test.ts`), not a bug, but it means the external
  uptime monitor silently can't authenticate if this secret drifts between
  the monitor's config and Dokploy's env.
- **Rate limiting is in-memory, per-instance.** `src/lib/rateLimit.ts`
  fails open if the limiter itself throws (never blocks legit traffic on
  an internal bug), but its budgets reset per process — if caramel-app
  ever runs as more than one instance, abuse limits are effectively
  multiplied by instance count until the documented `RateLimiterRedis`
  swap happens.

## Coupons ingest & bridge sync

The app owns the coupon catalog; the external Python pipeline SUPPLIES it. Two
feed paths share ONE engine (`applyCatalogRows` — a pure only-if-newer delta
upsert in a single transaction, guarded by the >20% tombstone gate). Full
contract: `docs/INGEST.md`.

- **Direct push (target state):** the pipeline `POST`s catalog deltas to
  `/api/ingest/catalog`, bearer-authed with `INGEST_API_KEY`. `200 {ok, applied}`
  on success; `409 {error, gate}` if the tombstone gate refused it (nothing
  written); `422` on an empty/invalid payload; `401` without the bearer.
- **Bridge sync (migration-period feed):** until the pipeline pushes directly,
  `pnpm --filter caramel-app bridge:sync` (needs `COUPONS_DATABASE_URL`, the
  read-only external connection string) reads the still-live external
  `caramel_coupons` Postgres (SELECT-only) and replays it through the same
  engine. It logs `OK` with per-entity counts, or `REFUSED`/`FAILED` and exits
  non-zero — never a silent no-op.

```bash
COUPONS_DATABASE_URL=<read-only-external-url> pnpm --filter caramel-app bridge:sync
```

**Tombstone-gate refusal (how to proceed).** A `409` (push) or `REFUSED`
(bridge) means the feed would expire >20% of the currently-visible catalog and
was rolled back untouched — the wholesale-wipe guard. A human verifies the
mass-expiry is legitimate (e.g. a genuine large delisting), then re-runs with
`force`: the push resends the same body with `"force": true`; the bridge needs
`runBridge(sql, { force: true })` (a `--force` CLI flag is a documented TODO in
`scripts/bridge-sync.ts`, to be wired by a human the first time it's needed).

**Catalog freshness.** Check it any time via `GET /api/health/db` — the
`catalog` check's `details` carries `{count, freshestUpdatedAt, ageMinutes,
stale}`. `stale: true` (newest row older than 48h) is observability only; it
never fails the check. Only an empty or unreachable catalog is a `503`.

## Post-deploy smoke check

`apps/caramel-app/scripts/smoke.ts` — hits `/` (expects `200` + HTML),
`/api/health/db` (expects `200` + every reported check `status: "ok"`),
and `/api/coupons?site=amazon.com` (expects `200` + a `coupons` array).
Prints `PASS`/`FAIL` per check and exits non-zero on the first failure.

```bash
BASE_URL=https://grabcaramel.com UPKUMA_HEALTH_SECRET=*** \
  pnpm --filter caramel-app run smoke
```

`BASE_URL` defaults to `http://localhost:58000` (the local dev port) if
unset. **Not wired into the Dokploy deploy pipeline** — this is a callable
command a human (or a future CI/CD step) runs after a deploy, not an
automatic gate. TODO(human): wire this into the actual Dokploy post-deploy
hook once the deploy trigger itself (see "Deploys & rollback" above) is
documented.

## Cross-hop trace correlation (coarse — known debt)

Sentry APM tracing (`tracesSampleRate: 1`, production-only) covers
in-process spans automatically, including outbound `fetch` calls
(`nativeNodeFetchIntegration`, on by default). Two real hops need more
than that:

- **OpenRouter** (`src/lib/openrouter.ts`): Sentry auto-spans the fetch,
  but OpenRouter doesn't participate in that trace. The `chat()` helper
  attaches an `X-Request-Id` header (a request id we generate — OpenRouter
  ignores it, but it's usable if outgoing requests are ever logged) and,
  on success, stashes both that id and OpenRouter's own response `id`
  (the generation id visible in OpenRouter's dashboard) as attributes on
  whatever Sentry span is active. This is annotation, not a new span —
  it's a no-op outside production (`Sentry.getActiveSpan()` is always
  `undefined` when Sentry isn't initialized).
- **coupon catalog** (`src/lib/couponsRepo.ts`): app reads are
  `prisma.$queryRaw` against `DATABASE_URL` (the same Prisma pool as auth_db),
  a raw SQL path with no header channel to carry a trace ID. The porsager
  `postgres` client now survives ONLY in `scripts/bridge-sync.ts`, which tags
  its read-only external connection `application_name: 'caramel-bridge-sync'`
  in `pg_stat_activity` — a per-process signal, not a per-request one.
- **Known debt:** full distributed tracing (a shared trace/request ID
  propagated end-to-end across the Next.js ↔ external Python
  coupon-verification service boundary) does not exist. What's here is
  intentionally coarse: it narrows "something's slow/broken" to a process
  and, for OpenRouter, a specific generation — it does not give you a
  single trace ID to paste into two different dashboards.

## Secrets & environment reference

`apps/caramel-app/.env.example` is the tracked source of truth (30 vars,
validated at boot by `src/lib/env.ts` — a misconfigured deploy fails fast
with a named error instead of breaking deep inside a request handler). The
operationally load-bearing ones:

| Var                      | Used for                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`           | auth_db + the app-owned coupon catalog (Prisma) — required                                                    |
| `COUPONS_DATABASE_URL`   | OPTIONAL, bridge-sync only — read-only external `caramel_coupons` connection string; unset in normal deploys  |
| `INGEST_API_KEY`         | bearer for `POST /api/ingest/catalog` (the coupons pipeline supplier push) — server-to-server, never a client |
| `COUPONS_ADMIN_SECRET`   | bearer for `POST /api/coupons/expire` + rate-limit trust exemption                                            |
| `UPKUMA_HEALTH_SECRET`   | bearer for `GET /api/health/db`                                                                               |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`     | extension cart classifier (`/api/classify-cart`) — unset throws a named `OpenRouterError`, not a silent no-op |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` | Sentry init (client + server) — unset means Sentry never initializes, production or not                       |

TODO(human): record where these are actually set/rotated in Dokploy (env
var UI vs. secret store) and the rotation procedure for
`COUPONS_ADMIN_SECRET` / `UPKUMA_HEALTH_SECRET` — not derivable from this
repo.
