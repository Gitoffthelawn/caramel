# Caramel Pre-Mortem — written as a postmortem from Jan 2027

Repo state audited: `dev` @ `537547b3081aa3a0ec817cdc5f6dac4f0d328dbb`. Read-only pass.
Priorities: maintainability, operability. Security architecture treated as accepted (findings below are framed as availability/contract/cost, not "is this secret safe").

## 1. The postmortem narrative

### What the quarter looked like (Q4 2026 → Jan 2027)

**The outage.** On a Tuesday the Python verification team — who own the `caramel_coupons` database that Next.js reads directly — shipped a routine migration to their own repo: they renamed `coupons.verification_message` and folded three coupon `status` values into a new one. They had no reason to think this would touch the web app; the web app is a different repo and the column rename was internal to their service. Within minutes every coupon surface on grabcaramel.com and every extension `fetchCoupons`/`fetchSupportedStores` call started returning `{ "coupons": [] }` and HTTP 500s. The Next.js app talks to that database through hand-written template-string SQL (`couponsSql`) with **no generated types, no schema, and no shared contract** (`apps/caramel-app/src/lib/couponsDb.ts`), so nothing caught the drift at build time — `pnpm tsc --noEmit` is green because the columns live in string literals.

The outage was not just likely; it was **invisible**. `/api/health/db` only runs `prisma.$queryRaw SELECT 1` against the _auth_ Postgres, which was perfectly healthy, so Uptime Kuma stayed green the entire time. Every coupon route `catch`es its error and returns a 500 after a `console.error` — and because the handlers catch, Next's `onRequestError` → `Sentry.captureRequestError` hook never fires and there is no `Sentry.captureException` in any catch block. So Sentry was silent too. The team found out from Discord and support tickets ~40 minutes in, then spent the incident reverse-engineering which of a dozen untyped SQL literals referenced the renamed column, because the app has no map of what it reads from the database it doesn't own. `.env.example` doesn't even list `COUPONS_DATABASE_URL`, so the newest on-call engineer initially didn't know the second database existed.

To make it worse, that same week a well-meaning infra change put the app behind a second replica for a marketing push. The rate limiter is an in-memory token bucket (`apps/caramel-app/src/lib/rateLimit.ts`) that `getClientIp` collapses to a single `'unknown'` bucket whenever `x-real-ip`/`x-forwarded-for` aren't set the way it expects — so a proxy tweak briefly funneled all traffic into one 120-req/min global cap and 429'd real users, and the classify-cart LLM cache (per-instance `Map`) halved its hit rate and doubled OpenRouter spend.

**The missed deadline.** The same quarter, the team committed to "auto-apply live on our top 40 stores across all browsers by end of quarter." It slipped badly, and the reasons are all structural. Adding a store or a coupon `status` means editing raw SQL string literals in four-plus routes that already disagree with each other (`coupons/route.ts` surfaces seven statuses; `stats`/`filters` only `'valid'`), with no compiler help and no single source of truth. Worse, the extension ships **three divergent manifests** — `manifest.json` (v1.1.0, matches `https://*/*`), `manifest-firefox.json` (v1.0.5, matches only amazon/ebay/codecademy and references an `amazon.js` file that does not exist in the repo), and `package.json` (v1.0.2) — so "ship it to all browsers" meant hand-reconciling files that had silently drifted for months, and the Firefox build only ever injected on three hard-coded domains regardless of what the store-config API served. The release workflow has no version-bump step, so two attempted Chrome uploads were rejected for duplicate version numbers before someone remembered to hand-edit the manifest. And every deploy required a human to remember to run `prisma migrate deploy` by hand (it is in no build/start script and no deploy config), which everyone was afraid to do during a feature crunch. The "40 stores everywhere" epic died by a thousand manual, drift-prone paper cuts — the same class of problem that caused the outage, viewed from the maintainer's chair instead of the pager's.

### The one-line thesis

The product's core data lives in a database this repo does not own, is read through untyped string SQL, and has **neither a health check nor error capture** — so any drift or outage in it is simultaneously easy to cause, invisible to monitoring, and expensive to change. Every other finding is a variation on "two representations of one thing that are allowed to drift."

## 3. Discard list (claims that failed my own quote test)

- **"`pnpm doctor` in checks-app.yml is a broken/no-op CI step."** DISCARDED — `pnpm doctor` is a real pnpm command ("Checks for known common issues", verified via `pnpm doctor --help`), so the "Validate dependencies" step is valid, if shallow. No defect.
- **Hardcoded EXTENSION_API_KEY / base URLs as a _security_ finding.** DISCARDED as security (out of scope per brief). Kept only the operability/rotation-coupling angle as PM-13.
- **Better-auth cookie SameSite/Secure and OAuth state-signing logic.** DISCARDED — this is auth/security architecture, explicitly accepted; the code (HMAC-signed state, timingSafeEqual, secure-cookie derivation) is deliberate and not a maintainability/operability defect.
- **"Coupons DB exposes mutations (increment/expire) from a 'read-only' client — inconsistency."** DISCARDED — couponsDb.ts explicitly scopes the two mutations and they are intentional; no drift/defect, just naming.
- **"In-memory classify-cart cache is unbounded."** DISCARDED — it is explicitly capped (CACHE_MAX 2000, 24h TTL) with LRU eviction; the real issue (per-instance, not shared) is captured under PM-6/PM-11, so no separate finding.
- **`ci-env.ts` writing SMTP\_\* that no code reads, as a standalone finding.** DISCARDED as standalone — folded into PM-8 as evidence of an unreconciled env surface rather than double-counted.
