 * README.md, this scripts/ directory (including the iOS simulator shell

 * downloaded by every user and read by every store reviewer. rsync also does
 * not exist on Windows, so `pnpm build` only ever worked in CI.
 *
 * So: an ALLOWLIST, and a test (tests/package-contents.test.mjs) that fails the
 * build if anything the manifests or index.html actually reference is missing
 * from it. Adding a file to the extension without adding it here is a red test,

/* ============================================================ environment
 *
 * Which deployment a build talks to is decided HERE, at packaging time, and
 * written into the artifact as `caramel-env.js`. It used to be decided at
 * runtime by `_isDevInstall()`, which read `chrome.runtime.getManifest()
 * .update_url` — a field the Chrome Web Store injects into installed
 * extensions. That heuristic is Chrome-only, and it was wrong everywhere else:
 *
 *   - Firefox/AMO listed add-ons must be uploaded WITHOUT an update_url, and
 *     manifest-firefox.json has none.
 *   - The Safari conversion produces a manifest with no update_url either
 *     (checked on the converted output: zero occurrences).
 *
 * So both of those SHIPPED builds looked like unpacked dev installs: they
 * pointed real users' API calls, login tab and store catalog at the dev
 * deployment, trusted a dev origin to postMessage a session token into
 * extension storage, and printed our internals into every store's console.
 *
 * Default is PRODUCTION, and dev takes an explicit `--env=development`. The
 * asymmetry is deliberate: the failure we are fixing is a shipped build
 * quietly talking to dev, whereas a local build talking to prod is a thing a
 * developer chose, on their own machine, with the flag right there in the
 * command they ran.
