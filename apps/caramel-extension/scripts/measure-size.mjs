/* Prepares what `size-limit` weighs: each shipped script, MINIFIED.
 *
 * The budgets used to be measured over raw source, which meant they priced
 * prose. Every explanatory comment this codebase's house style requires was
 * counted as if it were executable weight, and the consequence is written out
 * across .size-limit.js: seven raises in four days, most of them paying for
 * sentences, one of them an afternoon spent shaving comments to fit a budget
 * whose stated purpose is bounding CODE. A gate that makes documenting a fix
 * more expensive than shipping it is pushing in the wrong direction.
 *
 * So the numbers now come from minified output: comments and formatting are
 * gone before anything is weighed, and what remains is roughly the code. Add
 * fifty lines of explanation and the measurement does not move; add fifty
 * lines of logic and it does.
 *
 * ── minify, do NOT bundle ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * esbuild's transform API, one file at a time, never `build`. Bundling would
 * tree-shake, and tree-shaking a set of files whose entry points are the
 * BROWSER (a content script is injected, nothing imports it) would drop every
 * top-level function as unreachable and report a fraction of the real size —
 * a gate that reads green because it deleted the code it was supposed to
 * weigh. Per-file transform has no cross-file view and therefore no way to
 * decide anything is unused.
 *
 * ── what this does and does not bound ────────────────────────────────────────
 * Honest caveat: the shipped package is NOT minified. The WXT build ships
 * these modules with comments intact, so a store download really does carry
 * them. This gate deliberately does not measure that, because transfer size
 * is a once-per-install cost while the thing worth bounding is the code that
 * parses and runs on every store page a shopper visits. If the shipped
 * artifact ever needs a byte ceiling too, that is a second budget over
 * .output/ — not a reason to go back to pricing sentences.
