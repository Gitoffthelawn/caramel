// Codes are marked "tried" at attempt START so a full-page-POST apply that
// destroys the content script mid-flow doesn't make the next run re-grind the
// same codes from #1. That is right. What was wrong is that the mark STAYED
// even when the attempt proved nothing at all — and coupon-runner.js filters
// tried codes out of the manual copy list as well as the auto-apply queue, so
// the user loses the code in both directions for the rest of the tab session.
//
// Two independent live cases on 2026-08-05, both money:
//   toms.com  — TOMS15 won a verified -$11.25 earlier the same day. On a later
//               run the cart probe fell back to the DOM form, both attempts
//               read newTotal NaN, the user was told "didn't stick" with
//               TOMS15 offered as the code to paste BY HAND, and the re-run
//               logged SKIP_TRIED and could never reach it again.
//   bombas.com— NATE, badged "Verified" in our own popup and worth a real
//               -$11.10, disappeared from both the queue and the copy list,
//               leaving 16 unevidenced codes in its place.
//
// The same mechanism burns codes attempted against an EMPTY cart, where no
// total can move by definition.
