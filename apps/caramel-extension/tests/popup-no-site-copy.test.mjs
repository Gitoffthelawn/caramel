// One screen was answering three different questions with the same sentence.
//
// "No coupons for this site yet" is a verdict ABOUT A STORE — but this view is
// also where the popup lands when there is no store at all: a new tab, a PDF, a
// settings page, anywhere the extension cannot read a URL. Clicking the toolbar
// icon before going shopping is the most likely first thing a new user ever
// does with Caramel, and it answered with a judgement on a shop they were not
// in, plus a link to "the stores we support" that reads as an apology.
//
// It is also the only place the popup can say what the product IS. QA's
// first-time users had to work that out from a pill that shows up on a checkout;
// nothing in the extension ever introduces itself. The moment someone opens it
// with no store in front of them is precisely when that sentence helps.
//
// The third case — "we cover this store, nothing is working right now" — is
// pinned in tests/supported-but-no-codes.test.mjs.
