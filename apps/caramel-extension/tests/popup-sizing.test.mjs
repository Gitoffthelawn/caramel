// Regression pin, 2026-08-04. The popup shipped `body { width: min(420px,
// 100vw) }` and rendered as a narrow black column on a real Chrome install.
//
// A browser-action popup is sized FROM its content, so viewport units are
// circular: Chrome lays out with a tiny initial viewport, `100vw` resolves to
// that, the body shrinks to match, and nothing widens it again. The result is
// a ~35px column between the body's own min-height (320px) and max-height
// (600px), painted with --cm-bg -- which in dark mode is #171210, i.e. a
// plain black rectangle.
//
// This is a STATIC assertion on the stylesheet rather than a rendered-width
// check on purpose: jsdom has no layout engine, so it cannot reproduce the
// circular sizing that causes the bug. What it CAN do is make the specific
// mistake unrepeatable.
