    // for ~23 SECONDS, submitted two live codes to the merchant against zero
    // items, and then told the user to paste a code into an empty cart. From
    // the merchant's side that is indistinguishable from code-guessing traffic,
    // on every user who lands on an empty cart page. The extension's own
    // diagnosis was wrong too — it logged "no cart signal — checkout not
    // accepting injection", blaming a store that was behaving perfectly.
    //
    // Two independent signals, because the platforms differ: the cart payload
    // when probeCartJson() works (Shopify-class), and a readable total of zero
    // otherwise. `returnLargest` matters — it is the ORDER TOTAL, so a $0.00
    // reading means every number in the summary is zero, not just one line.
    // cricut.com and clarks.com already stay quiet on an empty cart, so this
    // aligns the rest of the fleet with behaviour users already get elsewhere.
    //
    // BUT the payload describes the STOREFRONT cart, and once a shopper is
    // inside the checkout it no longer describes what they are buying: Shopify
    // moves the items into the checkout session, so /cart.js on shop.<brand>.com
    // answers "0 items" for a cart that is plainly full. Measured on
    // bombas.com (2026-08-06): a $55.50 cart, one item, the store's own summary
    // reading "Total USD $70.50" one inch from our modal — and we told the
    // shopper their cart was empty and stopped, never attempting NATE, the one
    // code our own popup badges "✓ Verified" and which was worth $11.10 by hand.
    // Telling someone their full cart is empty is worse than the grind this
    // guard exists to prevent, so the payload is not consulted there.
    //
    // And neither signal may overrule the other: a claim this absolute needs
    // BOTH to be either empty or silent. Where they disagree, we simply carry
    // on and try codes, which is the recoverable mistake.
