// W1 (trust loop) — integration harness for the app-owned coupon_signals
// table. Unlike the unit suite (which mocks prisma), these run the REAL prisma
// client against a live local Postgres (compose's :58005 locally, or CI's
// postgres service). Separate config + a `tests/integration/**/*.itest.ts`
// glob for the same reason vitest.drift.config.ts is separate: `pnpm test`
// (the unit runner, F-004) includes ONLY tests/unit/** and CI's unit job has
// no DB, so a DB-touching test swept into it would hang. Run via
// `pnpm --filter caramel-app test:integration` after a `prisma migrate deploy`
// (the harness/CI applies migrations first).
//
// DATABASE_URL is read from this package's own .env via Node's built-in
// env-file loader (Node >=20.12) — the SAME real value `prisma migrate` uses,
// so the client and the migrations agree on which database they touch. It is
// deliberately NOT hardcoded in a `test.env` block below: a dummy there would
// override the real connection string and silently point the client at a
// database that was never migrated (the exact trap vitest.drift.config.ts
// documents). couponSignals.ts → prisma imports no env.ts, so no other env
// vars are needed here.
