-- Shopper-submitted coupon codes (owner-directed 2026-10-02).
--
-- Signed-in shoppers add codes to the app-owned `coupons` catalog, either
-- captured at checkout by the extension or typed on the store page. Two nullable
-- columns record who and how (both NULL on every supplier row), and a reserved id
-- sequence keeps shopper rows out of the supplier's id space.

-- Guard: the reserved range must be EMPTY of supplier ids before it is claimed.
-- If a supplier id already sits at or above the floor, shopper ids would collide
-- with it (or ingest would start refusing a row it already holds), so fail the
-- whole migration loudly instead of deploying a latent collision.
