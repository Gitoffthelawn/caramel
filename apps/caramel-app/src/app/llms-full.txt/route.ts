This is the full-length version of ${origin}/llms.txt.

## What Caramel is

- A browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari.
- Free to use, with no paid tier and no account required to install.
- Open source (AGPL-3.0) under the DevinoSolutions organization:
  ${GITHUB_REPO_URL}
- Built and maintained by Devino Solutions (https://devino.ca) together with
  community contributors.
- Positioned as an alternative to Honey for shoppers who care about privacy and
  about not hijacking creator commissions.

## How it works

1. You shop normally; Caramel detects a supported store's checkout page.
2. It looks up known coupon codes for that store from its own catalog.
3. It tries the codes at checkout and keeps the one with the best discount.
4. It reports whether a code worked so the catalog's rankings stay accurate.

## Privacy summary

Caramel never sells personal information and shares it only with the service
providers named in its privacy policy, and ships no ads and no third-party
trackers. The extension talks only to Caramel's own servers: at
checkout on a supported store it fetches coupon codes for that store's domain,
sends page and cart context (page title and item names — never payment
details) so the right category of codes is chosen, and reports whether a code
worked. Settings and the optional sign-in are kept in the browser's extension
storage. The full policy is at ${origin}/privacy.
