// POST /api/ingest/catalog — the ONE idempotent ingest endpoint of the coupons
// ownership inversion. The external coupons pipeline (a trusted supplier, NOT a
// browser) pushes catalog rows here the moment they change; the app owns the
// catalog and this is its only write door for supplier data.
//
// Auth: a server-only bearer (INGEST_API_KEY) via withRoute's apiKey:'ingest'
// gate (rateLimit.ts's isIngestAuthorized — constant-time, fail-closed on an
// unset key). Distinct from COUPONS_ADMIN_SECRET; never shipped to any client.
//
// Semantics (see src/lib/catalog/applyCatalogRows.ts): a pure DELTA UPSERT —
// each row applied only-if-newer by its own updated_at (idempotent, retry- and
// out-of-order-safe), the whole push transaction-atomic, and a push that would
// tombstone/expire >20% of the visible catalog is refused (409) unless the body
// carries force:true. A 1-row push and a 23k-row push take the identical path.
//
// NO CORS / NO OPTIONS / NO rate-limit: this is server-to-server (no browser
// Origin, no preflight), the bearer gate is the access control, and the trusted
// supplier is deliberately un-throttled so it can push changes as they happen.
// Anything that throws out of applyCatalogRows (bad data mid-batch, DB loss, …)
// propagates to withRoute's try/catch → handleRouteError → Sentry. Never
// swallowed.
