/**
 * The registrable domain a coupon `site` belongs to, or null if the input
 * doesn't name a real store.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Two copies of a hand-rolled `getBaseDomain` used to do:
 *
 *     const parts = hostname.split('.')
 *     return parts.length > 2 ? parts.slice(-2).join('.') : hostname
 *
 * "last two labels" is only the registrable domain under single-label public
 * suffixes. Under a multi-label suffix it collapses to the SUFFIX ITSELF:
 * `mymemory.co.uk` has three labels, so it became `co.uk`. couponsRepo then
 * matched `(site = 'co.uk' OR site LIKE '%.co.uk')` — every UK store in the
 * catalogue.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-08-05: a shopper checking out a £29.99 USB stick on
 * mymemory.co.uk was offered bareMinerals makeup codes. EVERY .co.uk and
 * .com.au host returned the same mixed bucket — 230 of 2,670 supported stores
 * (8.6%) — including `notarealstore12345.co.uk`, an invented domain that
 * cheerfully returned 50 coupons. The same helper feeds the public
 * /coupons/[store] pages, so those rendered as indexable pages for a fictional
 * store called "co.uk" carrying another brand's codes.
 *
 * tldts resolves against the real Public Suffix List, so co.uk, com.au, co.nz,
 * github.io and the rest are handled by data rather than by a label count.
 *
 * Returns null (rather than a bare suffix) when the input resolves to a public
 * suffix with no registrable label in front of it — `co.uk` is not a store, and
 * treating it as one is what produced the 50-coupon response above. Callers
 * must reject that, not query on it.

/**
 * The text to search the supported-store list with, from whatever a shopper

 * WHY THIS EXISTS. That search box's placeholder is `https://example.com`, so
 * shoppers type or paste URLs: `https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09…`,
 * `www.amazon.it/`, `https://youtooz.com`. The catalogue stores bare
 * registrable domains (`amazon.com`) and the search is a substring match, so
 * any scheme, `www.` or path made a supported store come back as "We don't
 * support that store yet" and pushed the shopper to "Request Support" for a
 * store we already carry (PostHog, 2026-09: 60+ such clicks in 60 days,
 * several on supported stores).
 *
 * A complete host resolves to its store domain (subdomains collapse, as on
 * the coupon pages) — except under a PRIVATE suffix (`myshopify.com`,
 * `github.io`), where the label in front IS the store: `mystore.myshopify.com`
 * stays whole, or the search would list every Shopify store instead. Anything
 * that is not a complete host yet — a partial type-ahead (`amaz`, `amazon.c`)
 * or a store name with spaces — keeps its stripped text, so the substring
 * match still suggests as you type.
