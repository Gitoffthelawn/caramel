// src/lib/catalog/applyCatalogRows.ts
//
// W3b — the shared write engine for the app-owned published catalog. ONE pure
// function of (payload) -> result, with NO HTTP concerns inside, so BOTH the
// ingest endpoint (POST /api/ingest/catalog, now) and the W4 external-catalog
// bridge (later) drive the exact same code path. A 1-row push and a 23k-row
// push take the identical path.
//
// The model is a pure DELTA UPSERT, never a snapshot/replace:
//   * Each pushed row carries its own `updated_at`. A row is applied ONLY when
//     it is at least as new as the stored row (only-if-newer) — so retries and
//     out-of-order delivery are idempotent and safe: replaying an old push, or
//     receiving pushes out of sequence, never regresses the catalog.
//   * Tombstoning (a coupon going expired / non-visible) happens PER ROW, when a
//     pushed row flips a currently-visible coupon to expired/non-visible —
//     NEVER by absence. A coupon missing from a push is simply not mentioned;
//     it is never deleted or expired for being absent. There is no batch-end
//     reconciliation and no file/snapshot semantics.
//
// The whole apply runs in ONE interactive transaction: a failure part-way
// through a multi-row push (e.g. a value that overflows a column) rolls back
// everything, so the catalog is never left half-written.
//
// Safety gate: a single push that would tombstone/expire more than 20% of the
// currently-visible catalog is REFUSED (409, `gated`) unless `force: true`.
// This guards against a broken producer wiping the catalog with one bad push;
// a genuinely large expiry is still possible by resending with force.
